                    <p>
                        Hello, I'm Bousselmi Bessem, a passionate developer hailing from <strong> Tunisia üáπüá≥ </strong>
                        . My deep
                        fascination
                        with technology, particularly in the realm of creating intelligent and innovative
                        products, has been a driving force throughout my career.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey as a coder began at the tender age of 13 when I stumbled upon ActionScript and
                        embarked on a thrilling adventure of building my very first video game. The experience was
                        nothing short of transformative, sparking an unwavering curiosity and a desire to explore the
                        endless possibilities of technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since then, my love for coding and problem-solving has only grown stronger. I've dedicated
                        myself to acquiring a wide range of skills and knowledge, constantly pushing the boundaries of
                        what I can create. With each project, I strive not only to deliver exceptional results but also
                        to leave a lasting impact on the field of technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My passion lies in developing new products that are not just functional but also intuitive
                        and innovative. I find immense joy in utilizing my technical expertise to craft experiences that
                        make people's lives easier, more enjoyable, and more connected.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Thank you for visiting my website, and I invite you to explore my portfolio and projects to get
                        a closer look at the exciting work I've been involved in. Feel free to reach out to me for
                        collaborations, opportunities, or just to say hello. Let's embark on a journey together to build
                        a future powered by innovation and creativity.

                        <h2> When I am not in front of my Linux computer.</h2>
                        <p>
                            I am a first-class enthusiast of the adorable <a
                                href="https://qoobee.com/"><strong>Qoobee</strong> </a>Character, and my fondness for it
                            knows
                            no bounds. But that's not all‚ÄîI have a weakness for the irresistible allure of donuts üç© and
                            lollipops üç≠ . They have a way of making me vulnerable, and it's astonishing how easily they
                            can manipulate me.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a proud cat dad üê±, my feline companion brings endless joy to my life. We share a special
                            bond, and I cherish every moment spent with my fur baby.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond my love for animals, I have a deep fascination with plants üå≥. Exploring the world of
                            botany is a constant source of excitement for me. I'm always seeking new ways to create and
                            innovate, finding ways to support and protect our natural world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ‚âß‚ó°‚â¶ But often times you find me without money because of my love of buying trivial and Cute
